                <h4>Reasons for a weather forecast</h4>
                <p class="author-article">By Meteorologist Jeff Haby.</p><br/>
                <p> There are several reasons why weather forecasts are important. They would certainly be missed if they were not there. It is a product of science that impacts the lives of many people. The following is a list of various reasons why weather forecasts are important:<br/><br/>
                    1. Helps people prepare for how to dress (i.e. warm weather, cold weather, windy weather, rainy weather)<br/><br/>
                    2. Helps businesses and people plan for power production and how much power to use (i.e. power companies, where to set thermostat)<br/><br/>
                    3. Helps people prepare if they need to take extra gear to prepare for the weather (i.e. umbrella, rain coat, sun screen)<br/><br/>
                    4. Helps people plan outdoor activities (i.e. to see if rain/storms/cold weather will impact outdoor event)<br/><br/>
                    5. Helps curious people to know what sort of weather can be expected (i.e. a snow on the way, severe storms)<br/><br/>
                    6. Helps businesses plan for transportation hazards that can result from the weather (i.e. fog, snow, ice, storms, clouds as it relates to driving and flying for example)<br/><br/>
                    7. Helps people with health related issues to plan the day (i.e. allergies, asthma, heat stress)<br/><br/>
                    8. Helps businesses and people plan for severe weather and other weather hazards (lightning, hail, tornadoes, hurricanes, ice storms)<br/><br/>
                    9. Helps farmers and gardeners plan for crop irrigation and protection (irrigation scheduling, freeze protection)<br/><br/>
                    10. Helps people involved with certain activities to know if conditions will be good (i.e. skiing, boating, ballooning)<br/><br/>
                    11. Helps people know outside weather dangers (i.e. heat index, wind chill, severe weather)<br/><br/>
                    12. Helps people plan for when to do certain activities that are influenced by weather (i.e. fertilizing, bug spraying, gardening)<br/><br/>
                    13. Helps people know if they need to leave early for work<br/><br/>
                    14. Make an uncertain future a little more certain (i.e. knowing changes that will occur in weather).<br/><br/>
